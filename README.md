# Cobra

In this assignment you'll implement a small language called Cobra,
which implements an en-**Co**-ded **B**-inary **R**-epresent-**a**-tion
of different values.  It also uses `C` function calls to implement some
user-facing operations, like _printing_ and _reporting run-time errors_.

## Download 

1. Use the _fork link_ from the class website to create your private clone of the starter code.

2. Do `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse131-fa18/00-warmup-XXX` where `XXX` is your private repo.

3. Link your clone to the "upstream" to get any updates

```
$ make upstream
```

after this you can get "updates" (in case we modify the starter code), with 

```
$ make update 
```

4. Save (and submit) your work with: 

```
$ git commit -a -m MESSAGE
$ git push
```



## The Cobra Language

As usual, there are a few pieces that go into defining a language for us to
compile.

1. A description of the **concrete syntax** – the text the programmer writes

2. A description of the **abstract syntax** – how to express what the
   programmer wrote in a data structure our compiler uses.

3. A description of the **semantics** — or **behavior** —of the abstract
  syntax, so our compiler knows what the code it generates should _evaluate_.

### Concrete Syntax

The concrete syntax of `cobra` is:

```
<expr> :=
  | let <bindings> in <expr>
  | if <expr>: <expr> else: <expr>
  | <binop-expr>

<binop-expr> :=
  | <identifier>
  | <number>
  | true
  | false
  | add1(<expr>)
  | sub1(<expr>)
  | isNum(<expr>)
  | isBool(<expr>)
  | print(<expr>)
  | <expr> + <expr>
  | <expr> - <expr>
  | <expr> * <expr>
  | <expr> < <expr>
  | <expr> > <expr>
  | <expr> == <expr>
  | ( <expr> )

<bindings> :=
  | <identifier> = <expr>
  | <identifier> = <expr>, <bindings>
}
```

### Abstract Syntax

The abstract syntax is defined by the data type `Expr`:

```haskell
data Prim1
  = Add1
  | Sub1
  | Print
  | IsNum
  | IsBool

data Prim2
  = Plus
  | Minus
  | Times
  | Less
  | Greater
  | Equal

data Expr a
  = Number  !Integer                       a
  | Id      !Id                            a
  | Prim1   !Prim1    !(Expr a)            a
  | Prim2   !Prim2    !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a
  | Let     !(Bind a) !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a
  | If      !(Expr a) !(Expr a)  !(Expr a) a

data Bind a
  = Bind !Id a
```

#### ANF Expressions

An **immediate** expression is a
* constant `Number n`, or
* identifier `Id x`.

```haskell
{-@ measure isImm @-}
isImm :: Expr a -> Bool
isImm (Number  _ _) = True
isImm (Id      _ _) = True
isImm _             = False

{-@ type ImmExpr a = {v:Expr a | isImm v} @-}
```

An **A-Normal Form (ANF)** expression is one where every argument
for a `Prim1` or `Prim2` or conditional (in an `If`) is **immediate**

```haskell
{-@ measure isAnf @-}
isAnf :: Expr a -> Bool
isAnf (Number  _ _)    = True
isAnf (Id      _ _)    = True
isAnf (Prim1 _ e _)    = isImm e
isAnf (Prim2 _ e e' _) = isImm e && isImm e'
isAnf (If c t e _)     = isImm c && isAnf t && isAnf e
isAnf (Let _ e e' _)   = isAnf e && isAnf e'

{-@ type AnfExpr a = {v:Expr a| isAnf v} @-}
```

The above is **very similar to the constructs for** `boa` -- the main additions are
the new primitives.

### Semantics

With the addition of two types to the language, there are two main changes
that ripple through the implementation:

1. **Representation of Values**
2. **Possibility of Errors**

There is one other major addition, which is the `print` primitive, discussed
more below.

The representation of values requires a definition.  We'll use the following
representations for the Cobra runtime:

- `true` will be represented as the constant `0xFFFFFFFF`
- `false` will be represented as the constant `0x7FFFFFFF`
- numbers will be represented with a zero in the rightmost bit, as in class.
  So, for example, `2` is represented as `0x00000004`.

#### Printing

**You will fix** the provided `print` function in `main.c` to print these
values correctly: `true` and `false` should print as those words, and numbers
should print out as the underlying number being represented.

```c
// c-bits/main.c
int print(int val) {
  printf("Unknown value: %#010x\n", val);
  return val;
}
```

A `print` expression in `cobra` should pass the value of its  subexpression to
the `print` function in `main.c`, and evaluate  to the same value (`print` in
`main.c` helps out here by returning  its argument).   The main work you need
to do here is similar to when calling an  error function; evaluate the argument, push it onto the stack  with `push`, and then `call` into `print`.


#### Run-time Type Checking

You should raise errors in the following cases:

- `-`, `+`, `*`, `==`, `<`, and `>` should raise an error (by printing it out) with
  the substring `"expected a number"` if the operation doesn't get two numbers
  (you can print more than this if you like, but it must be a substring)

- `add1` and `sub1` should raise an error with the substring `"expected a
  number"` if the argument isn't a number

- `+`, `-`, and `*` should raise an error with the substring `"arithmetic
  overflow"` if the result overflows, and falls outside the range representable
  in 31 bits. The `jo` instruction (not to be confused with the Joe Instructor)
  which jumps if the last instruction overflowed, is helpful here.

- `if` should raise an error with the substring `"expected a boolean"` if the
  conditional value is not a boolean.

The code for the above will be part of your implementation of:


```haskell
-- lib/Language/Cobra/Compiler.hs
-- | TBD: Implement code for `Prim1` with appropriate type checking
compilePrim1 :: Tag -> Env -> Prim1 -> IExp -> [Instruction]
compilePrim1 l env op v = error "TBD:compilePrim1"

-- | TBD: Implement code for `Prim2` with appropriate type checking
compilePrim2 :: Tag -> Env -> Prim2 -> IExp -> IExp -> [Instruction]
compilePrim2 l env op = error "TBD:compilePrim2"

-- | TBD: Implement code for `If` with appropriate type checking
compileIf :: Tag -> Env -> IExp -> AExp -> AExp -> [Instruction]
compileIf l env v e1 e2 = error "TBD:compileIf"
```

These error messages should be printed on standard _error_, so use a
call like:

```c
fprintf(stderr, "Error: expected a number")
```

I recommend raising an error by

1. **Adding fixed code** to the _end of your generated assembly_ that
2. **Calls into** `error` functions that you will implement in `main.c`.  
3. Also don't forget to declare the functions from `main.c` that you call as
   `extern` in the `header` variable in `Asm.hs`.

For example, you might insert code like:

```nasm
internal_error_non_number:
  push eax
  call error_non_number
```

Which will store the value in `eax` on the top of the stack, move `esp`
appropriately, and perform a jump into `error_non_number` function,
which you will write in `main.c` as a function of one argument.

The other operators, `isNum`, `isBool`, and `print`, cannot raise
errors, and always succeed.

### Examples

```haskell
let x = 1 in
let y = print(x + 1) in
print(y + 2)

# will output

2
4
4
```

The first 2 comes from the first print expression.  The first 4 comes from the
second print expression.  The final line prints the answer of the program as
usual, so there's an “extra” 4.

```python
if 54: true else: false

# prints (on standard error) something like:

Error: expected a boolean in if, got 54
```

## Implementing Cobra

### Memory Layout and Calling C Functions

In order to set up the stack properly to call C functions, like `print` and
your error functions, it's necessary to make a few changes to what we
had in Boa.

- **Allocating stack space ahead of time**: At the start of our generated code
  (which we now recognize is a function body participating in a C runtime
  stack), we need to make sure we make enough stack space for all variables we
  create, and reserve that space ahead of time.  To do this, we move `esp` to
  point to a location that is N words away (so N * 4 bytes for us), where N is
  the greatest number of variables we need at once.  This is actually tricky
  to compute to be fully optimal (teaser for later in the semester: by
  “tricky” I mean NP-hard), but it's easy to get an OK heuristic – we can
  compute the maximum depth of nested definitions.

  To do this, we need the `countVars` function, which we implemented in
  class, so I've provided it.  You need to add instructions to the provided
  spot in `funEntry` in order to make sure the correct space is allocated
  on the stack by subtracting the right amount from `esp`.

- **Using the Base Pointer**: In addition, this means that all variable
  references need to happen from `ebp` rather than from `esp`.  This is
  because `esp` can change while we are pushing arguments onto the stack for
  other function calls, so `ebp` is the place we should trust for consistent
  offsets.

- **Participating in the C stack**: As a C function callee (from `main`) and
  caller (of error functions and `print`), our code has some responsibilities.
  First, we need to store the old base pointer upon entry, and update the
  base pointer to hold the current top of the stack (which includes the return
  pointer into main, for example).  This is why the typical top two lines of
  most C functions are:

  ```
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp
  ```

  Similarly, when we're done with the function, we need to restore the stack
  pointer to its old location, and put the old base pointer value back.  This
  is why the last lines before a `ret` in a C function are often:

  ```
  mov esp, ebp
  pop ebp
  ```

- **Other Responsibilities**: If we were using registers beyond `eax`, `ebp`,
  and `esp`, we'd be responsible for storing some of them as callee, and some
  as caller.  But we're not going to go into those details for this
  assignment.  Since we aren't using those registers, it has no effect on our
  code's behavior.

You need to account for the above by filling in appropriate implementations
for


```haskell
-- lib/Language/Cobra/Compiler.hs

-- | TBD: insert instructions for setting up stack-frame for `n` local vars
funEntry :: Int -> [Instruction]
funEntry n  = error "TBD:funEntry"

-- | TBD: cleaning up stack-frame after function finishes
funExit :: [Instruction]
funExit   = error "TBD:funExit"
```


### New Assembly Constructs

- `Sized`

    You may run into errors that report that the _size_ of an operation is
    ambiguous.  This could happen if you write, for example:

    ```
    mov [ebp-8], 0
    ```

    Because the assembler doesn't know if the program should move a four-byte
    zero, a one-byte zero, or something in between into memory starting at
    `[ebp-8]`.  To solve this, you can supply a size:

    ```
    mov [ebp-8], DWORD 0
    ```

    This tells the assembler to use the “double word” size for 0, which
    corresponds to 32 bits.  A `WORD` corresponds to 16 bits, and a `BYTE`
    corresponds to 8 bits.  To get a sized argument, you can use the `Sized`
    constructor from `arg`.

- `HexConst`

    Sometimes it's nice to read things in hex notation as opposed to decimal
    constants.  I've provided a new `HexConst` `arg` that's useful for this
    case.

- `IPush`, `IPop`

    These two instructions manage values on the stack.  `push` adds a value at
    the current location of `esp`, and increments `esp` to point past the
    added value.  `pop` decrements `esp` and moves the value at the location
    `esp` was pointing to into the provided arg.

- `ICall`

    A call does two things:

      - Pushes the next _code_ location onto the stack (just like a `push`),
        which becomes the return pointer
      - Performs an unconditional `jmp` to the provided label

    `call` does not affect `ebp`, which the program must maintain on its own.

- `IShr`, `IShl`: Bit shifting operations

- `IAnd`, `IOr`, `IXor`: Bit masking operations

- `IJo`, `IJno`: Jump to the provided label if the last arithmetic operation
  did/did not overflow

As usual, full summaries of the instructions we use are at [this assembly
guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html).


### Testing Functions

**Make sure your error messages match the error messages from the instructions
and/or tests exactly!**

The testing code is the same as for `boa`. ANF conversion is provided,
and hasn't changed aside from the addition of new primitives,
so your tests should focus on the compilation-and-execution tests.
As usual, fill in new tests in `yourTests.json` following the earlier format.

An old friend is helpful here, too: `valgrind`.  You can run

```
$ valgrind output/some_test.run
```

in order to get a little more feedback on tests that fail with `-10` as their
exit code (which usually indicates a SEGFAULT).  This can sometimes tip you off
quite well as to how memory is off, since sometimes you'll see code trying to
jump to a constant that's in your code, or other obvious tells that there's
something off in the stack.  Also, if you've done all your stack management
correctly, `valgrind` will report a clean run for your program!

The creators of the **5 hardest tests** get **5%** of total points as **extra credit**

* You can add up to 10 new tests in `tests/yourTests.json`

* Feel free to add more, we'll just take the first 10.

* A test's "score" is the total number of compilers
  (submitted by the entire class) on which the test
  produces the **wrong** output.

* That is, the **harder** a test, the **higher** its score.

### Recommended TODO List

Here's _one_ order in which you could consider tackling the implementation:

1. Fix the `print` function in `main.c` so that it prints out the right
   output.  It will need to check for the tag using C bitwise operators,
   and use `printf` to print the right value.

2. Take a first shot at figuring out how to increase the stack appropriately
   by using `countVars` and implementing `funEntry` and `funExit`

3. Fill in the `Prim1` case for everything but `print`, and figure out
   how to check for errors, and call the "non-number" error reporting
   function.  Test as you go.  Be aware that if the function call
   SEGFAULTS, it may be because you need to refine step 2.

4. Implement `print` by compiling it to with a call to the `print` after
   pushing appropriate arguments.  Be aware that if the call doesn't work, it
   may be because of step 2 again.  Test as you go; be aware that you should
   test interesting sequences of `print` expressions and let-bindings to make
   sure your stack integrity is good before and after calls.

5. Fill in all of the `Prim2` cases, using the error-reporting from
   the last step.  Test as you go.

6. Complete the `If` case and test as you go.
